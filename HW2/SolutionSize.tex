\section{Solution Size}
As the number of cities to traverse increases, the possible solutions increases which makes search harder.  For all the experiments run in this assignment, 10,000 solutions were generated before stopping the search.  A generated solution could have been a duplicate of a solution already produced.  As a result, the number of solutions searched over cannot be determined for sure.  However, as an upper bound, the uniquenes of solutions will be assumed.

Even with only 15 cities, less than 1 millionth of a percent of the space searched is sufficient to find a near optimal solution.
